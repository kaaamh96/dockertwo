from flask import Flask



app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, world!'

if  __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5002)


#run the app and click link
python3 app.py

touch dockerfile

FROM python:3.8-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install flask
EXPOSE 5002
CMD [ "python", "app.py"]


#created an image which is a snapshot of app

docker build -t bye_flask .        (. means current directory,if it was saved elsewhere this would change)


#run the container on same port for host and container 
docker run -d -p 5002:5002 bye_flask

# refresh the page it will be running 

# run docker ps to find info on that container
